# Security policy

## Supported versions

Shaffof is in the planning stage. The only thing running is the home page at https://shaffof.wonmor.io, deployed from the
`main` branch. Security fixes go to `main` and are deployed to the site; there are no older versions to patch.
When releases exist, the latest release receives fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue, pull request or discussion for a vulnerability.

1. Preferred: GitHub private vulnerability reporting, in this repository's **Security** tab,
   then **Report a vulnerability**: <https://github.com/wonmortech/shaffof/security/advisories/new>.
2. If you cannot use GitHub: a private message on Telegram to <https://t.me/xnosir>. A short first message such as
   "Security report for Shaffof" is enough; we will agree on a safe way to share the details.

Include the affected URL or file, the steps to reproduce, and what an attacker could gain. Never send live
credentials or other people's personal data, even as proof.

## What happens next

| Step | What we do | Within |
|---|---|---|
| Acknowledge | Confirm we received your report | 7 days |
| Assess | Reproduce it and rate its severity (CVSS) | 14 days |
| Fix | Fix and deploy high and critical issues, sooner where possible | 60 days |
| Disclose | Publish a GitHub security advisory (and a CVE where needed) with the fix | With the fix |

We credit reporters in the advisory if they wish. Good-faith research that follows the
[organization security policy](https://github.com/wonmortech/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) is welcome and
covered by its safe-harbour section. There is no paid bug bounty.

A machine-readable contact file is published at [https://shaffof.wonmor.io/.well-known/security.txt](https://shaffof.wonmor.io/.well-known/security.txt).
The security design of the project is described in [docs/ASSURANCE.md](docs/ASSURANCE.md).

## Verifying a release

Each release on GitHub is a reproducible archive of `site/` with a checksum file and build provenance. The
provenance is signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) through GitHub artifact attestations by
[.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml), which builds the archive twice and publishes
it only if both builds are byte-identical. To check a download (here `v0.1.0`) with the
[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```sh
gh release download v0.1.0 -R wonmortech/shaffof
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
gh attestation verify shaffof-site-0.1.0.tar.gz -R wonmortech/shaffof
```

`sha256sum -c` must print `OK` for the archive, and `gh attestation verify` must report that the attestation
was verified and that the archive was built by `release.yml` in `wonmortech/shaffof`. A failure of either
means the file is not the one we published: do not use it, and report it as described above.
